A full description of this data is available at [this website.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Download run_analysis.R into the folder containing the UCI HAR dataset and set the folder as your working directory in R.

## Running the script
Source run_analysis.R into console

A data frame, X_features_mean will be created in your Global Environment which is a tidy data set with the average of each variable on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (Yo Dawg!) for each activity and each subject in the training and testing data sets (more on this below).
